## Summary 
This project implements 2-dimensional Vector Based Amplitude Panning (VBAP). VBAP is a technique used to position sound objects at a desired position in space using a set of Head-related Impulse Responses (HRIRs), also called Head-related Transfer Functions (HRTFs) when used in the frequency domain.

## Usage
To execute the file, clone repo and run the executable `finalProject`

This code is not currently being maintained, but feel free to raise an issue if you run into bugs.
